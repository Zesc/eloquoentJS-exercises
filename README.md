# Eloquoent Javascript End of Chapter exercises

This is my a small project that will help practice my front-end development skills.

TODO:
- Get all my js code until chapter 6
- Figure out how to represent each exercise in html
- Figure out how show/hide a code block
- create input boxes for users to try the exercises.
- Learn how to apply some interaction in the web page.
